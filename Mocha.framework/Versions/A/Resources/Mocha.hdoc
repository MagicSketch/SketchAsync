 * @discussion
 * Mocha is a runtime that bridges JavaScript to Objective-C. It is built on top of JavaScriptCore,
 * the component of WebKit responsible for parsing and evaluating JavaScript code, and BridgeSupport,
 * which enables libraries to expose the definition of their C structures and functions for use at
 * run-time (as opposed to compile-time).
